# Game of Thrones App

This app was created using the Game of Thrones Character API https://thronesapi.com/.
The chosen API was this because it's simple since it give us all the data required with
just one endpoint.

## Characteristics

- Architecture: I decided to use an architecture despite the assessment could not required one,
because in my opinion doing it on this way you can ensure that you project would be scalable and testable.
The architecture chosen was CLEAN ARCHITECTURE due it divide our project in different layers. These
layers are called DATA, DOMAIN, PRESENTATION. In each one of them there are sublayers DATA[datasources, models, repositories], DOMAIN[usecases, entities, repositories], PRESENTATION[state management, widgets].


- State Management:
- Authentication with local persistency:
- Dependency Injection:
